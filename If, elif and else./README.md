* Python doesn't use bracket to seperate block of code it uses white space instead.
* Code in the script are executed sequentially from the first to the last.
* Python uses the if keyword to implement decision control.
* Python uses else condition to define an alternate block of code to be executed if the boolean expression in the if condition comes as False.
* Python uses elif condition to include multiple conditional expressions between the if and else conditions.

Note :
      * In if & elif if two statements or code are correct then it will execute 1st one.
